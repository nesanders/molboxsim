molboxsim
=========

Very simple molecular dynamics simulation.

## Known issues ##

* ~~Molecules seem to bunch up at the position 0,0 over time~~
* Coordinate transformation for the overplotted png image is very kludgy.
* Evaporation is not quite implemented yet

## Errata ##

* mol_sim_mayavi.py is a failed attempt to use the mayavi 3D plotting package to render the simulation.
